## Draft prompt

I want to organize a public policy analysis course for legislative interns in the New York State Assembly around a bill that we can research and analyze together. I'd like your help picking such a bill. It might not be a current bill but might be a bill that was enacted 1, 2, or maybe 3 years ago. I want the bill and issue to have some or all of the following characteristics:

-   At least moderately controversial, although it does not need to be a change-the-world bill.

-   Some researchable legislative history. For example, it may have been amended one or more times as it moved through the process. It may have been vetoed in an earlier iteration, so that we can examine a veto message. It was debated on the Assembly or Senate floor at least once, so that we can read a debate transcript. Perhaps a similar or related bill was enacted a year or two earlier, so that we can read the bill jacket associated with the bill.

-   Not overly long or technical. Perhaps 1-4 pages of legislative text. The topic and legislative language should be reasonably accessible to a smart policy analyst.

-   Raises issues that might affect different parts of the state differently, so that students can research how, for example, upstate-downstate differences in politics, or incomes, or race relate to the bill.

-   May raise one or more federal or state constitutional issues that need to be considered in examining the bill.

-   The underlying issue the bill addresses has elements that may have been the subject of academic research. For example, if the bill changes prison sentencing guidelines, perhaps there is academic research relating to the impact of sentencing guidelines. If it changes education funding, perhaps there is research on the relationship between funding and student academic performance, and so on - whatever the underlying issue is, it would be nice if there is some academic research on the topic.

-   May raise implementation issues - might involve coordination with the federal government, or with local governments, or it may involve setting up new administrative procedures to implement it, or it may have other challenges that could affect how the bill should be structured.

-   Important stakeholders - for example advocacy organizations, or unions, or business organizations have staked out positions on the bill. Perhaps they have issued reports, or press releases, or made statements giving their positions and the reasons for those positions.

Can you suggest 1-4 bills that might meet most of these criteria? It would be ideal to provide the bill number, topic, sponsor, and year, but if you cannot do that, it would good to at least provide the topic and sponsor.
