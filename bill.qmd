## Background

## Analyze the bill and law

### Steps

-   **What is current law** and how would the bill change it?

    Make sure to examine current law carefully. Use the Senate site for laws and explain how it works. Show how to read the law.

-   Compare the bill to what the sponsor's memo says.
