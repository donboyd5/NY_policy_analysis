# The bill

## Background

Read:

## Analyze the bill and law

### Steps

-   Get the bill package from the Assembly site (check LRS??) and explain the info that is available.

-   Read the sponsor's memo to understand what the sponsor says the bill does, and why, and to see whether there are important facts or issues to investigate.

-   **What is current law** and how would the bill change it?

    Make sure to examine current law carefully. Use the Senate site for laws and explain how it works. Show how to read the law.

-   Examine the bill in detail. Obtain help as needed.

-   Compare the bill to what the sponsor's memo says.

## Analysis A.4454 Good Cause Eviction

Get the A.4454 bill, memo, and related documents from the [NY Assembly website](https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A04454&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y). I like to check all of the boxes to get all of the available information.

You can read the package online, or save the entire package as a pdf. I use the free Google Chrome extension PrintFriendly, but many other approaches will work, too. Here's a [pdf](resources/A4454of2024/A4454_2024_package_optimized.pdf) of the package.

## Questions

## Review the bill package

Here's what's in the package, some of which we'll look at now and some of which we'll dig into later:

-   **Bill summary**: lists same-as or same-as-uni bill in the Senate (if there is/was one) with clickable link; Assembly sponsor's last name, lists of co-sponsors (active endorsers) and multi-sponsors (supporters not actively involved) if any[^bill-1], laws amended, brief description.

-   **Bill actions**: brief legislative history of the specific bill in the current 2-year legislative term, including introduction, committee referrals and actions, amendments, floor action, and gubernatorial action if any

-   **Committee votes**: if the bill was voted on in a committee, gives the date, committee, and vote by each member

-   **Floor votes**: if there was a floor vote, gives date and vote by member

-   **Bill memo**: sponsor's memo, if available; may not be available for governor's bills

-   **Text**: text of the bill

-   **LFIN (Local Fiscal Impact Note)**: if NY Legislative Law section 51 requires a note with estimates of the impact of a bill on a county, city, town, village, special district or school district it will be mentioned here (Rule III, section 2, subdivision i)

-   **Chamber Video/Transcript**: gives date of any floor debate, and links to transcript and possibly video of the debate

[^bill-1]: The Assembly rules do not distinguish between co-sponsors or multi-sponsors, referring only to multi-sponsors; the distinction is made informally and isn't always meaningful. ([Rule III](https://www2.nyassembly.gov/Rules/?sec=r3#r3), section 3)

## Reviewing the sponsor's memo

The sponsor's memo can tell us about the intent of the bill and useful things about how it will operate. Some sponsors' memos are detailed and accurate, while others are quite general and sometimes out of date. We always read these memos but don't assume they are accurate or complete.

Assemblymember Hunter's memo says the purpose of A.4454 is "To set standards for which eviction is acceptable and prohibit eviction without good cause, giving tenants expanded protection." It gives the following justification:

> Renters across all of New York deserve stable housing and should not be subject to unfair evictions. By setting standards in law for when evictions are appropriate, renters will be protected from unfair practices that seek to evict them through no fault of their own. Tenants who pay their rent on time and lease responsibly should not be held to things such as drastic rent increases that are done for no other reason than forcing these tenants out. These increases are often far above what would be considered fair market. In circumstances where tenants are causing a nuisance or fail to pay fair rent, for example, tenants may still be evicted.

The memo does not provide details on the scope of the bill or how it would work, but we will read the text of the bill for that.

The memo says the bill has no fiscal implications (for the state or its local governments).

## Reviewing the bill text

Reading the bill carefully from beginning to end is essential to understanding the proposal. Never assume bill memos or advocacy or opposition reports describe the bill accurate. Read the bill, and seek out professional reviews from others.

The parts of a bill are described in the [Assembly rules, Rule III, Section 1](https://nyassembly.gov/Rules/?sec=r3#r3). Among other things, the bill title, section introductions, and bill sections have to clearly state the bill's subject, clearly reference existing and proposed laws that would be amended, and clearly show how the bill would change existing law.

### The preamble

Here's the preamble to A.4454 (everything through the enacting clause). It tells us the bill number, the 2-year legislative session, the house, the introduction date, main sponsor and multi-sponsors, the laws being amended and subject, and the enacting clause. A.4454 was introduced in the first year of the 2023-2024 session, by Assemblymember Hunter, with about 40 multi-sponsors . With work, we could determine how many cosponsors were Democrats, how many were Republicans, and where they are from, among other things.
