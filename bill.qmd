# The bill

## Background

Read:

## Analyze the bill and law

### Steps

-   Get the bill package from the Assembly site (check LRS??) and explain the info that is available.

-   Read the sponsor's memo to understand what the sponsor says the bill does, and why, and to see whether there are important facts or issues to investigate.

-   **What is current law** and how would the bill change it?

    Make sure to examine current law carefully. Use the Senate site for laws and explain how it works. Show how to read the law.

-   Examine the bill in detail. Obtain help as needed.

-   Compare the bill to what the sponsor's memo says.

## Analysis A.4454 Good Cause Eviction

Get the A.4454 bill, memo, and related documents from the [NY Assembly website](https://www.assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A04454&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y&LFIN=Y&Chamber%26nbspVideo%2FTranscript=Y). I like to check all of the boxes to get all of the available information.

You can read the package online, or save the entire package as a pdf. I use the free Google Chrome extension PrintFriendly, but many other approaches will work, too. Here's a [pdf](resources/A4454of2024/A4454_2024_package_optimized.pdf) of the package.

## Questions

## Review the bill package

Here's what's in the package, some of which we'll look at now and some of which we'll dig into later:

-   **Bill summary**: lists same-as or same-as-uni bill in the Senate (if there is/was one) with clickable link; Assembly sponsor's last name, lists of co-sponsors (active endorsers) and multi-sponsors (supporters not actively involved) if any[^bill-1], laws amended, brief description.

-   **Bill actions**: brief legislative history of the specific bill in the current 2-year legislative term, including introduction, committee referrals and actions, amendments, floor action, and gubernatorial action if any

-   **Committee votes**: if the bill was voted on in a committee, gives the date, committee, and vote by each member

-   **Floor votes**: if there was a floor vote, gives date and vote by member

-   **Bill memo**: sponsor's memo, if available; may not be available for governor's bills

-   **Text**: text of the bill

-   **LFIN (Local Fiscal Impact Note)**: if NY Legislative Law section 51 requires a note with estimates of the impact of a bill on a county, city, town, village, special district or school district it will be mentioned here (Rule III, section 2, subdivision i)

-   **Chamber Video/Transcript**: gives date of any floor debate, and links to transcript and possibly video of the debate

[^bill-1]: The Assembly rules do not distinguish between co-sponsors or multi-sponsors, referring only to multi-sponsors; the distinction is made informally and isn't always meaningful. ([Rule III](https://www2.nyassembly.gov/Rules/?sec=r3#r3), section 3)
