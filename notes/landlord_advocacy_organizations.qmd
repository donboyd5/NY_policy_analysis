## Follow-up Question to ChatGPT

What about the Real Estate Board of New York? Why didn't you list them in your first response?

## ChatGPT Response

I didn’t list the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) initially because the sources I found during my search focused on other landlord advocacy organizations and legal perspectives specifically related to the Good Cause Eviction law. The content did not mention REBNY directly in the context of statewide Good Cause Eviction concerns, though they are a significant player in New York City's real estate landscape and often involved in policy discussions affecting landlords.

If you'd like more specific information about REBNY's position on this issue, I can search for their statements or materials.
