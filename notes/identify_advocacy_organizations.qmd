# Identifying Advocacy Organizations

-   **Identify the Policy's Stakeholders** – For any policy proposal, identify the affected stakeholders (e.g., tenants, landlords, businesses, environmental groups). Understanding who stands to gain or lose helps pinpoint which organizations might be involved.

-   **Review Legislative Documents** – Examine bill sponsors, co-sponsors, and committee meetings. Legislators often collaborate with advocacy groups when drafting or pushing policies. Look for submitted testimonies and position papers.

-   **Explore News Reports and Op-Eds** – Media outlets often mention organizations and coalitions advocating for or against policies. Search news articles, op-eds, and press releases for relevant names.

-   **Use Lobbying Disclosures** – Review JCOPE's lobbying disclosures to identify organizations that have registered lobbying efforts for or against specific bills. This can highlight which groups are actively involved in advocacy.

-   **Follow the Money** – Use campaign finance reports to track donations related to specific policy areas. Donor patterns can reveal organizations supporting particular legislative efforts.

-   **Engage with Networks** – Connect with local policy professionals, attend public hearings, or join policy-focused forums and conferences where advocacy organizations often present their viewpoints.

-   **Consult Public Records** – Look for public comments submitted to government agencies during regulatory changes. Advocacy groups often provide detailed positions on policy impacts.
