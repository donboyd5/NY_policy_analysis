# High-Quality Evidence

## Reading

[here](resources/general/buck_stuart_2015_arnoldventures.org-Important%20Lessons%20About%20Reproducibility%20in%20Science.pdf)

**Evaluating sources**: Read the following parts of the *UC Berkeley Guide to Evaluating Resources*:

o   The [home page](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=83917&p=539735). Pay special attention to questions under *In-Depth Guide*.

o   Read the [Scholarly and Popular Sources](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=83917&p=3747680) subpage.

o   Read the [Finding Historical Primary Sources: Getting Started](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=4409&p=15606) subpage.

## A general framework

1.  **Types of Evidence**:

    -   **Anecdotal**: Personal stories or isolated examples. While they can be powerful and illustrative, they don't provide comprehensive evidence.

    -   **Descriptive**: Offers a description or snapshot of a situation, but doesn't explain why the situation exists.

    -   **Empirical**: Evidence based on data and facts. This can come from surveys, experiments, and other research methods.

    -   **Expert Testimony**: Provided by individuals with specialized knowledge on a subject.

2.  **Source Credibility**:

    -   Check the qualifications of the source.

    -   Examine potential conflicts of interest.

    -   Consider the reputation of the organization or publication.

3.  **Recency**: Data and information can become outdated, especially in fields that change rapidly.

4.  **Relevance**: Ensure the evidence directly relates to the policy question at hand.

5.  **Sample Size & Representativeness**:

    -   Larger samples can provide more reliable evidence.

    -   The sample should be representative of the population it's meant to describe.

6.  **Consistency**:

    -   Is the evidence consistent with other available evidence?

    -   Contradictory evidence doesn't necessarily discredit a claim, but it necessitates further investigation.

7.  **Methodology**:

    -   Check how the data was collected and analyzed.

    -   Peer-reviewed studies typically have reliable methodologies.

    -   Be wary of studies with significant methodological flaws.

8.  **Bias & Objectivity**:

    -   Examine the purpose of the study. Was it designed to achieve a particular outcome?

    -   Consider the funding source of the research.

9.  **Generalizability**: Can the findings be applied to larger or different populations or settings?

10. **Magnitude of Effects**: Even if an effect is statistically significant, consider its practical significance.

11. **Causality vs. Correlation**: Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one caused the other.

## More notes - I think I summarized these from Berkeley

### Authority

-   Who is the author?

-   What else has the author written?

-   In which communities and contexts does the author have expertise?

-   Does the author represent a particular set of world views?

-   Do they represent specific gender, sexual, racial, political, social and/or cultural orientations?

-   Do they privilege some sources of authority over others?

-   Do they have a formal role in a particular institution (e.g. a professor at Oxford)?

### Purpose

-   Why was this source created?

    -   Does it have an economic value for the author or publisher? 

    -   Is it an educational resource? Persuasive?

        -   What (research) questions does it attempt to answer?

        -   Does it strive to be objective?

    -   Does it fill any other personal, professional, or societal needs?

-   Who is the intended audience?

    -   Is it for scholars?

    -   Is it for a general audience?

### Publication & format

-   Where was it published?

-   Was it published in a scholarly publication, such as an academic journal?

    -   Who was the publisher? Was it a university press?

    -   Was it formally peer-reviewed?

-   Does the publication have a particular editorial position?

    -   Is it generally thought to be a conservative or progressive outlet?

    -   Is the publication sponsored by any other companies or organizations? Do the sponsors have particular biases?

-   Were there any apparent barriers to publication?

    -   Was it self-published?

    -   Were there outside editors or reviewers?

-   Where, geographically, was it originally published, and in what language?

-   In what medium?

    -   Was it published online or in print? Both?

    -   Is it a blog post? A YouTube video? A TV episode? An article from a print magazine?

        -   What does the medium tell you about the intended audience?

        -   What does the medium tell you about the purpose of the piece?

### Relevance

-   How is it relevant to your research?

    -   Does it analyze the primary sources that you're researching?

    -   Does it cover the authors or individuals that you're researching, but different primary texts?

    -   Can you apply the authors' frameworks of analysis to your own research?

-   What is the scope of coverage?

    -   Is it a general overview or an in-depth analysis?

    -   Does the scope match your own information needs?

    -   Is the time period and geographic region relevant to your research?

### Date of Publication

-   When was the source first published?

-   What version or edition of the source are you consulting?

    -   Are there differences in editions, such as new introductions or footnotes?

    -   If the publication is online, when was it last updated?

-   What has changed in your field of study since the publication date? 

-   Are there any published reviews, responses or rebuttals?

### Documentation

-   Did they cite their sources?

    -   If not, do you have any other means to verify the reliability of their claims?

-   Who do they cite?

    -   Is the author affiliated with any of the authors they're citing?

    -   Are the cited authors part of a particular academic movement or school of thought?

-   Look closely at the quotations and paraphrases from other sources:

    -   Did they appropriately represent the context of their cited sources?

    -   Did they ignore any important elements from their cited sources?

    -   Are they cherry-picking facts to support their own arguments?

    -   Did they appropriately cite ideas that were not their own?
