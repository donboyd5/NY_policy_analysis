## A general framework

1.  **Types of Evidence**:

    -   **Anecdotal**: Personal stories or isolated examples. While they can be powerful and illustrative, they don't provide comprehensive evidence.

    -   **Descriptive**: Offers a description or snapshot of a situation, but doesn't explain why the situation exists.

    -   **Empirical**: Evidence based on data and facts. This can come from surveys, experiments, and other research methods.

    -   **Expert Testimony**: Provided by individuals with specialized knowledge on a subject.

2.  **Source Credibility**:

    -   Check the qualifications of the source.

    -   Examine potential conflicts of interest.

    -   Consider the reputation of the organization or publication.

3.  **Recency**: Data and information can become outdated, especially in fields that change rapidly.

4.  **Relevance**: Ensure the evidence directly relates to the policy question at hand.

5.  **Sample Size & Representativeness**:

    -   Larger samples can provide more reliable evidence.

    -   The sample should be representative of the population it's meant to describe.

6.  **Consistency**:

    -   Is the evidence consistent with other available evidence?

    -   Contradictory evidence doesn\'t necessarily discredit a claim, but it necessitates further investigation.

7.  **Methodology**:

    -   Check how the data was collected and analyzed.

    -   Peer-reviewed studies typically have reliable methodologies.

    -   Be wary of studies with significant methodological flaws.

8.  **Bias & Objectivity**:

    -   Examine the purpose of the study. Was it designed to achieve a particular outcome?

    -   Consider the funding source of the research.

9.  **Generalizability**: Can the findings be applied to larger or different populations or settings?

10. **Magnitude of Effects**: Even if an effect is statistically significant, consider its practical significance.

11. **Causality vs. Correlation**: Just because two variables are correlated doesn\'t mean one caused the other.
