# Proposed versus other states

## Question to ChatGPT 4-o

In early 2024, there was a proposal in the NY Assembly known as Good Cause Eviction (A.4454). Please tell me about already-enacted state or local GCE laws in other states, whether for specific municipalities or statewide. Please compare them to A.4454 along major dimensions. After describing these differences, please prepare a comparison table.

## Response

Several states and municipalities outside New York have enacted or proposed Good Cause Eviction (GCE) laws. Notable examples include:

### **California**

-   **Statewide Law**: Limits rent increases to 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 10%, whichever is lower. Rent control applies to buildings over 15 years old.

-   **Comparison to A4454**: The California law provides a more specific and uniform limit on rent increases. Unlike A4454, it includes age restrictions on which properties are covered.

### **New Jersey**

-   **Statewide Law (1974 Anti-Eviction Act)**: Lists 17 reasons for eviction and limits rent increases.

-   **Comparison to A4454**: New Jersey's law has a broader list of potential eviction causes and an established history, whereas A4454 was a newer proposal with potentially stricter rent increase limitations.

### **Oregon**

-   **Statewide Law**: Limits annual rent increases to 7% plus CPI, with exceptions for new constructions within the first 15 years.

-   **Comparison to A4454**: Oregon's law has a higher cap on rent increases and specific exceptions for newer buildings, which were not part of A4454’s proposal.

### **Local Differences in New York State**

-   **Upstate Cities (Albany, Ithaca, etc.)**: Opted into the statewide GCE law but tailored it to define "small landlords" as those with just one unit, unlike the 10-unit exemption in New York City's version. Some cities also set different thresholds for maximum fair market rent.

-   **Comparison to A4454**: These local adaptations in New York allow for stricter definitions and exemptions, reflecting differing regional housing markets and tenant protections.

### Summary Table

| Aspect | A4454 (NY Proposal) | California | New Jersey | Oregon | Upstate NY Cities |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Rent Increase Limit** | 3% or 1.5x CPI, whichever greater | 5% + CPI or 10%, whichever lower | Varies (no set percentage) | 7% + CPI | Local adjustments (e.g., 245% FMR) |
| **Property Age Restrictions** | None | Buildings \> 15 years old | None | Buildings \> 15 years old | None |
| **Small Landlord Exemption** | Owner-occupied \<4 units | Not explicitly defined | Not explicitly defined | Not explicitly defined | Often 1-unit owners |
| **Cause for Eviction** | Specific “good causes” | Similar, limits on unjust eviction | 17 specific grounds | Specific good causes | Adapts state law |

The differences between A4454 and other states' GCE laws reflect varied approaches to balancing tenant protections and landlord rights, shaped by local housing markets and legislative priorities​([Shelterforce](https://shelterforce.org/2024/07/12/in-upstate-new-york-the-fight-for-good-cause-continues/)).
